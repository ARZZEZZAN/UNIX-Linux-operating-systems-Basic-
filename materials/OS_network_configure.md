## ## Network interfaces
Network interfaces are used to transfer data between programs over a computer network. \
In Linux, any data that a computer sends to or receives from the network goes through a network interface. \
Network interfaces can be either physical or virtual. \
Here are examples of network interfaces types:
- eth -- Network interface to Ethernet or WaveLan (Radio Ethernet) cards.
- ax -- Network interface to AX.25 amateur radio devices.
- arc0e, arc0s -- Network interface to ArcNet card. Ethernet or RFC 1051 packet encapsulation is used.
- wlan -- The network interface for wi-fi adapters.

## DHCP
Any device needs an IP address to function over a network. In IPv4 protocol, it is a numeric identifier consisting of 4 digits, each separated by a dot, without which the device cannot be identified in the network infrastructure. \
The DHCP application protocol does all the work of selecting network settings automatically, without the need to manually give each device its own IP address. This simplifies the job of the system administrator in case of network expansion.
